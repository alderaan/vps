# DEBUG NETWORKING ISSUE - RESOLVED

## Root Cause: UFW Firewall Blocking Container-to-Host Traffic

### Problems Solved:
1. **DNS Resolution**: Fixed by adding `/etc/hosts` mapping in container
2. **Firewall Blocking**: UFW was blocking port 9000 access from Docker networks
3. **Service Management**: HostAgent now running properly as systemd service

### Final Solutions Applied:
1. **UFW Rule**: Added firewall rule to allow port 9000
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 9000
   ```

2. **DNS Mapping**: Container has proper hostagent.local → 153.92.4.240 mapping

3. **HostAgent Service**: Running as system service via systemd
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status host-agent  # Check status
   sudo journalctl -u host-agent -f  # View logs
   ```

## Current Status:
✅ **Networking**: Container can reach HostAgent on port 9000  
✅ **HostAgent**: Service running and responding to health checks  
❌ **Authentication**: MCP backup failing with "No valid session ID provided"  

## Next Steps:
- Investigate Bearer token authentication between ai-dev-server and HostAgent
- Check if MCP connection is stable after container restarts
